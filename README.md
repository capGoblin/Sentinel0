# Sentinel0 - Your Super secure and lightweight digital storage.

## What?

Our project, Sentinel0, is a decentralized file storage application that leverages 0G's storage layer and Secret Network's Decentralized Confidential Computing (DeCC) layer. It is designed to ensure data privacy while empowering users with complete ownership of their files. Using **0G Storage** for decentralized file management and **Secret Network** for privacy, our app securely stores user files in a decentralized format, allowing users to share, access, and control their data with full ownership. Each file’s integrity is maintained by generating a unique root hash, which is encrypted and securely stored in the Secret Network, ensuring that only authorized addresses can access it. Additionally, **SecretPath** facilitates the seamless transfer of encrypted data **from any EVM chains to the Secret Network**. This means users get all the benefits of decentralized storage with privacy that’s typically missing in Web3 solutions.

## What is 0G Storage?

**0G Storage** is a high-performance, infinitely scalable storage system tailored for decentralized applications. It supports data-heavy and performance-centric applications in Web3, offering:

- **Decentralized Data Availability**: Ensures high throughput and availability through a sample-driven consensus mechanism.
- **Redundancy and Integrity**: Employs erasure coding and consensus for redundancy, safeguarding data against failures.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Uses a flexible pricing model to keep storage affordable, making it ideal for long-term data-heavy applications.
- **Privacy Compatibility**: Integrates seamlessly with privacy networks like Secret Network, enhancing data confidentiality and user privacy.


## Why Built It with 0G Storage and Secret Network 

We chose **0G Storage** for its high scalability, cost efficiency, and optimized performance for data-heavy dApps. Unlike Web2 services like Google Drive or Web3 alternatives like IPFS, **0G Storage** ensures infinite scalability and real-time data retrieval while remaining highly affordable. This makes it the ideal choice for users who want decentralized control without sacrificing speed or reliability.

**Secret Network** brings in the critical privacy layer. By encrypting file root hashes and storing them on-chain, only users with the correct viewing key (e.g., those you’ve shared with) can decrypt and view file information. This integration of privacy ensures that user data isn’t just stored on-chain—it’s stored safely, out of reach of unauthorized eyes, creating a truly decentralized, private Google Drive experience.


## Why 0G Outshines Competitors

### Performance and Throughput
- **0G Storage**: Delivers high throughput and low latency, essential for dApps with significant data needs.
- **Web2 (AWS, Google Drive)**: Though fast, these centralized solutions don’t provide user-owned data and often come with high API costs for heavy data usage.
- **Web3 (IPFS)**: Known for latency issues due to peer-based data retrieval, making it less reliable for real-time data access.

### Scalability
- **0G Storage**: Uses sample-driven Data Availability and erasure coding for near-limitless scalability, handling large data without compromising speed.
- **Web2 (AWS)**: Scaling requires costly expansions and potentially complex configurations.
- **Web3 (IPFS, Arweave)**: Struggles to scale for high-throughput applications due to dependency on a distributed network of nodes.

### Cost Efficiency
- **0G Storage**: Maintains low, predictable costs ideal for dApps, eliminating the high prices associated with conventional cloud storage.
- **Web2 (AWS)**: Charges for data storage, retrieval, and replication, quickly becoming costly for large data.
- **Web3**: While Arweave offers a pay-once model, the up-front cost can be prohibitive.

## How Privacy Benefits with Secret Network

Combining **0G Storage** with **Secret Network** provides an unparalleled solution for privacy-focused applications, ensuring that user data is not only securely stored but also maintained with complete confidentiality.

- **Encrypted File Storage with Privacy Keys**: Root hashes of files are securely stored on Secret Network and encrypted, allowing access solely through user-specific viewing keys. This means that only authorized users can access sensitive file information.

- **SecretPath for EVM Cross-Chain Access**: Through **SecretPath**, users can access their stored data from low-fee EVM-compatible chains, adding a layer of convenience and flexibility. This cross-chain capability allows users to interact with their files across different blockchain environments, facilitating seamless integration with their preferred blockchain ecosystems.

- **Secure File Sharing**: The use of unique viewing keys enables users to share files securely and efficiently. This method simplifies the sharing process while eliminating the vulnerabilities often associated with traditional permission systems, providing a more robust approach to data sharing.

## Conclusion

This decentralized Google Drive alternative represents a significant step forward in data management, leveraging the power of **0G Storage** and **Secret Network** to offer unparalleled security, privacy, and efficiency for users in the Web3 ecosystem.
